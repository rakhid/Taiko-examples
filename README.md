# Taiko-examples
This project has small scripts that help you understand how to operate Taiko



This is how you have to use each file :

# File 1:basicTaikoCommands.js

# This file sends a "Working from home" notification from your GMAIL id to any email id.
To execute this file you have to input 3 parameters in the following format

taiko basicTaikoCommands.js <senders-gmail-id>  <senders-gmail-password> <recievers-email-id> 
  
##P.s.Make sure the gmail id you use does not have 2 factor authentication.
